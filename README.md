Encapsulation

Description: Keep data and methods together in one place.
Importance: Protects the data and makes the code more secure.
Abstraction

Description: Hide complex details and show only what’s necessary.
Importance: Simplifies how you interact with the system.
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Description: Each part of the program should have only one reason to change.
Importance: Makes the system easier to understand and maintain.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Description: Software should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Importance: Allows adding new features without changing existing code.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Description: Subtypes should work as well as their base types.
Importance: Ensures new classes can replace old ones without breaking the system.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Description: Don’t force users to depend on interfaces they don’t use.
Importance: Improves flexibility and reduces unnecessary dependencies.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Description: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
Importance: Makes the system more flexible and less dependent on specific details.
Following these principles helps build software that is more reliable, adaptable, and easier to maintain

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in Software Design
Modularity is a design principle that divides a software system into separate, self-contained units or modules, each responsible for a specific function. These modules can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, and they interact with each other through well-defined interfaces.

How Modularity Improves Maintainability and Scalability
Maintainability

Isolation of Changes: Changes in one module usually do not affect other modules. This makes it easier to locate and fix bugs, update features, or optimize parts of the system without impacting the entire codebase.
Easier Debugging: With modularity, it is simpler to debug and test individual parts of the system. Developers can focus on a single module at a time, reducing complexity.
Reusability: Modules can be reused across different parts of the system or in different projects, reducing the amount of code that needs to be written and maintained.
Clear Structure: A modular structure makes the codebase easier to understand and navigate. Each module has a clear purpose, making it simpler for new developers to get up to speed.
Scalability

Independent Development: Teams can work on different modules simultaneously without interfering with each other, speeding up the project and allowing for scalability in team size.
Modular Expansion: New features can be added as new modules without altering the existing ones, making it easier to grow the system over time.
Load Distribution: Different modules can be deployed on separate servers or scaled independently, optimizing resource usage and improving performance.
Improved Testing: Modular systems allow for unit testing of individual components, ensuring that each part functions correctly before integrating it into the larger system, reducing integration issues.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Testing is a crucial activity in software engineering that involves evaluating a software system to ensure it meets specified requirements and is free of defects. The goal of testing is to identify and fix issues before the software is deployed to users.
